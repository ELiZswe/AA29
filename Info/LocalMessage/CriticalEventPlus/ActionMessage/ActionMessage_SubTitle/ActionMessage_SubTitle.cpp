A tournament where the winners become gods and the losers pay the ultimate price!","THERE THEY ARE! Once they were rivals, but now they're one of the fiercest teams around.","That's right. Nothing beats experience and each one of these three brings loads of it to the table.","Look at Malcolm! Now there's a guy who can really keep his cool in a fire-fight.","That Brock. He's as dangerous to the ladies OUT-side the ring as he is to his foes IN-side!","I love watching Lauren.
